# Functional Accessibility Evaluator, version 2.2

Development is primarily supported by the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu).  The development is lead by [DRES Accessible IT Group](https://accessibleit.disability.illinois.edu) which is a unit of [Disability Resources and Educational Servcies](https://www.disability.illinois.edu) which is part fo the [College of Applied Health Sciences](https://www.ahs.illinois.edu).  Additional contributions for the [HTMLUnit](http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/) based web site analysis engine are provided by [Administrative Information Technology Services (ATIS)](https://www.aits.uillinois.edu/) of University Administration.

## Version 2.2

## What is Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE)?
* FAE analyzes a website based on the requirements of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 Single A and AA Success Criteria.
* Every rule used in FAE 2.x references at primary WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion requirement it is based on.
* The rules support not only accessibility, but also usable web design for people with disabilities.
* The rules support accessible and usable design by enforcing the accessible coding practices and techniques of the Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA) 1.0 and W3C HTML5 specifications.

## Apache 2.0 License
FAE may be used and distributed based on the terms and conditions of the [Apache License Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

### Apache 2.0 configuration notes

* MOD_WSGI must be installed and support Python 3.6

#### Sample Apache configuration gile

```
<VirtualHost *:80 >

  Servername  [fae.somedomain.org]
  ServerAlias [fae.somedomain.org]

  Alias /static /var/www/fae2/fae2/fae2/fae2/static/

  <Directory /var/www/fae2/fae2/fae2/fae2/static>
    Require all granted
  </Directory>

  <Directory /var/www/fae2/fae2/fae2>
    <Files wsgi.py>
     Require all granted
    </Files>
  </Directory>

  WSGIDaemonProcess fae2 python-path=/var/www/fae2/fae2/fae2:/var/www/fae2/fae2env/lib/python2.7/site-packages
  WSGIProcessGroup  fae2

  WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/fae2/fae2/fae2/fae2/wsgi.py process-group=fae2

</VirtualHost>
```

### Initializing and updating the database tables
* You will need to run django `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands to update any changes (or to create the initial database) for the django apps used in FAE.
* This needs to be done after updating to a new version of FAE.
* For your convience there is a script `init_apps` that can be used to setup the initial migrations and run migrate


```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

```

### Setting up fae directories for read/write access
* Need to create `data` directory with write permissions for `apache` user and group `root` user
* Need to create `logs` direcotry with write permissions for `apache` user and group `root` user


### Multiple Django Apps and mod_wsgi
* [Configuring wsgi.py for multiple Django apps](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/)

### Setup Static Files
* Enable the virtual environment for fae so it is available from the command prompt:<br/>`source [path to virtual environment]/bin/activate`.
* Change directory to the fae directory with the file `manage.py'.
* You will need to run the following command to copy static files to the static directory:<br/><code>python manage.py collectstatic</code>

### Initialize database tables
* If not already enabled, enable the virtual environment for fae so it is available from the command prompt:<br/>`source [path to virtual environment]/bin/activate`.
* Change directory to the fae directory with the file `manage.py'.
* Run the following command to create the tables in the database:<br/><code>python manage.py migrate</code>
* After the tables in the database are created, go to the "populate" directory.
* In the populate directory initialize the tables using the following command:<br/><code>python pop_all.py</code>

### fae-util configuration and testing
* Purpose of fae-util
  * fae-util is a server based browser emulator based on HTMLUnit
  * It monitors the database waiting for evaluation requests
  * When it identifes a request it will then load web pages and analyze them using the OpenAjax Evaluation Library
  * Each page evaluation results in a JSON file being crerated with the results
  * After all pages are analyzed the information in the JSON files is moved to the database
* Testing fae-util
  * Go to the "fae-util" directory
  * Use "./build" function to build the java classes
  * Use <code>./run -c test.properties</code> to test if the utility is properly installed and configured
  * It will output URL processing information to the console
  * It will create a directory called "test" that contains *.json files of evaluaiton results
  * NOTE: You must delete the "test" directory to rerun this test (e.g. directory exists error will occur)
* Creating a service to run evaluation requests
  * IMPORTANT: Must run <code>fae-util/python process_evaluation_requests.py</code> to process website evaluations in the background
  * There are a number of ways to make this program run in parallel with django application depending on your operating system
    * Linux: How to write a System V init script to start, stop, and restart my own application or service(http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-write-sys-v-init-script-to-start-stop-service.html)


### Utility to clean up reports and update summary statistics
* IMPORTANT: Must run <code>fae-util/process_achive_reports.py</code> to process remove reports and update summary statistics
* Create cron job to run a shell script once a day
* The shell script contains the following command lines:
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env bash
<path to virtual environment>/python <path to fae-util>/fae-util/process_achive_reports.py
</pre>

## InCommon (Shibboleth) Configuration

To enable shibboleth support through [InCommon](https://www.incommon.org) for your institution or organization you need your service manager to enable the following attributes to the entityID identifying the installation of FAE with Shibboleth Support (e.g. "https://fae.illinois.edu/shibboleth" for the University of Illinois campus):
* eppn
* giveName
* sn
* mail

Enityt IDs: [https://www.incommon.org/federation/info/all-entities.html#IdPs]

## Testing e-mail on localhost development
* Use a python utitlity to simulate an SMTP server: <code>python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025</code>
* Configure e-mail in "secretes.json" with the following values:
```
    ....
    "EMAIL_HOST": "localhost",
    "EMAIL_PORT": 1025,
    "EMAIL_USE_TLS": false,
    "EMAIL_HOST_USER": "None",
    "EMAIL_HOST_USER_PASSWORD": "None",
    ....

```

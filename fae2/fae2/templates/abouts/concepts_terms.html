<p>FAE and AInspector WCAG for Firefox use the <a href="">OpenAjax Evaluation
    Library</a> the following concepts are important in understanding the terms and relatiohnships of the rules, rulesets and evaluation results of the library.  The OpenAjax Evaluation Library is based on the requirements</p>

<h3>More about rules, target resources and result values</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A rule tests target resources for specific accessibility features.</li>
    <li>Some rules are fully automated and return pass or fail results and messages.</li>
    <li>Other rules can only identify the need for human judgement to determine if an accessibility requirement has been met. These return manual check results and messages.</li>
    <li>If target resources are not found on the page, the rule result is designated as not applicable.</li>
    <li>If target resources for a rule are hidden, the rule result is designated as hidden. The hidden resources are included in the element results list to enable developers to consider their accessibility if and when they become available to users.</li>
    <li>Rules also include information on accessibility techniques and links to related resources to help developers understand how to meet the requirements of a rule.</li>

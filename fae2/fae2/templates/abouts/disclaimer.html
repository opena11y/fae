<h2>Accessibility Evaluation of WCAG 2.0</h2>
<ul>

    <li>The default rulesets used in the Functional Accessibility Evaluator 2.1 (FAE)
        are based the requirements of the Level A and Level AA success criteria of the
        <a class="external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The approach of FAE 2.1 is to support accessibility techniques
        based on the <a class="external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.0/">W3C Accessible Rich Internet Accessibility Specification</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML5</a> through the technques defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/">WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/">HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are many potential techniques to meet the requirements of WCAG 2.0 and the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">W3C WCAG 2.0 Techniques document</a> provides examples of <em>some</em> of the techniques that can be used satisfy the requirements.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>Please be aware of the following limitations in the use of FAE:</p>

<ul>

    <li>While passing all of the FAE rules will generally improve the accessibility of web pages,
        it should <strong>not</strong> be inferred from this that all WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA accessibility
        requirements have been met.
        We encourage you to become familiar with all the accessibility requirements of WCAG 2.0 and
        to be sure to implement them in your designs, including requirements that can only be
        tested manually.  FAE identifies in the report many of the manual checks you will need to perform or
        account for in your design and qaulity assurance requirements. </li>

    <li>FAE and its test components may not be able to interpret all markup; we recommend
        that you validate your documents to improve the ability of FAE to interpret markup.</li>

    <li>If you are using accessibility techniques for conforming to WCAG 2.0 that are not identified in a ruleset,
         this may result in not passing some of the rules used for evaluating accessibility.</li>
</ul>

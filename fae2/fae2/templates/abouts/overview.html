    <h2>What is FAE?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE) 2.3 analyzes web pages for requirements
            defined by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_spec">W3C Web Content
            Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> Level A and AA Success Criteria.</li>

        <li>FAE and AInspector for Firefox use the <a href="https://github.com/opena11y/evaluation-library">OpenA11y Evaluation Library</a> rules and rulesets.  Every rule used in FAE 2.3 references a primary WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion requirement.</li>

        <li>The rules are based on the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices">Authoring Practices</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/" target="_spec">W3C Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA)</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5" target="_spec">HTML5</a> specifications</li>

        <li>The rules used in FAE and AInspector have been developed over six years through the work of the <a href="https://github.com/opena11y/evaluation-library">OpenA11y Accessibility Task Force</a> and feedback from users of FAE and AInspector for Firefox.  The OpenA11y Evaluation Library rules and rulesets and are based on the Level A and AA success criteria defined in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">W3C Web Content Guidelines 2.0</a> using best practices for implementing accessibility defined in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/">W3C ARIA Authoring Practices</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/">W3C ARIA in HTML</a> specifications.
       </li>

        <li>FAE is designed to be used in conjunction with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ainspector-wcag/">AInspector for Firefox</a> and <a href="http://accessibility-bookmarklets.org/">Accessibility Bookmarklets</a> to help people understand the accessibility features, issues and potential issues of a web resource.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The &ldquo;Run FAE&rdquo; page provides a form for specifying the following analysis parameters:</p>

    </table>

    <p>After successfully completing the analysis, FAE displays the Summary Report, which provides a high-level view of the evaluation results, and places a link to this report in the Archived Reports list. This list includes additional report information such as the analysis date/time, the number of pages analyzed, the report title, the starting URL and the depth of evaluation.</p>

    <h2 id="rule_categories">Rule Categories</h2>

    <p>FAE organizes the analysis of documents based on the following rule categories:</p>

    <table class="details table table-striped table-hover" aria-labelledby="rule_categories">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th class="text">Category</th>

            {% for rule_category in rule_categories %}
            <tr>

<p>The original purpose of the Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE) when it was released in 2004 was to raise awareness of web accessibility issues beyond putting ALT attributes on images and labels on form controls, for example use of heading on a web page.  FAE went on from there to what I believe was the first website spidering tool to include at least one rule for every <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0">WCAG 2.0</abbr></a> Level A and AA requirements, based the best practices of the HTML and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Accessibility">ARIA</abbr> standards</a>.  FAE has been a labor of love for many people, but the web and web accessibility has significantly changed since it was first introduced, and this requires a pause to take time to reflect on the future of FAE.  There are limited resources to continue the development of FAE to support the latest web standards and the maintenance of a fee-based FAE service is under additional scrutiny from University Auditors.</p>

      <p>The original purpose of the Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE) when it was released in 2004 was to raise awareness of web accessibility issues beyond the simple rules of ALT attribute on images and the labeling form controls, for example the structured use of headings was one of the original rules.  FAE went on from there to be the first website spidering tool to include at least one rule for every <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0">WCAG 2.0</abbr></a> Level A and AA requirements.  The rules are based on HTML and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Accessibility">ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices</a> to encourage authors to learn more about accessibility requirements and best practices</a>.  FAE has been a labor of love for many people, but the web and web accessibility has significantly changed since it was first introduced, and this requires a pause to reflect on the future of FAE and the FAE service.  The use of FAE has been declining over the past several years and there are limited resources to support updating FAE to comply with the latest web technologies and standards.  To help us understand the current needs of designers, developers and testers we are restarting our <a href="https://accessibleit.disability.illinois.edu/open-source-tools-user-group/">Open Source Web Accessibility Tools User Group</a> to learn more about what types of tools are needed to make web accessibility evaluation and inspection more robust and efficient.</p>
